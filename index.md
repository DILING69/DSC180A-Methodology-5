1. The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the basics of soc design.
2. A potential investigation the I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is benchmarking the paper that we re-implemented this quarter.
3. A potential change I'd make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is to work with circuit design with restricted variations
